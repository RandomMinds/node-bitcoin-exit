# monitrc configuration for node-bitcoin-exit
#
# This should be added to the monitrc on the same server that is running
# the exit node.
#
# The configuration assumes that you have upstart installed and the
# example upstart script for node-bitcoin-exit set up.
#
# Make sure you go through an change things like the port and paths if
# your configuration deviates from the defaults.
